# Fake-News-Classifier

Aim
  - To classify fake news based on the title using NLP and Neural Networks
  - 1st Model
    - Used Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier
    - Comparing the above two ML algorithms
  - 2nd Model
    - Using LSTM, one-hot representation
    - Sequential model with sigmoid activation function
    - Binary Cross entropy as loss function

  - Conclusion
    - Classification of Fake news into binary class labels was performed with an accuracy of over 90%
    - Gained insights of how different models work on the same type of data to for my own intuitions and to draw some conclusions
