# Fake-News-Classifier

Aim :  To classify fake news based on the title using NLP and Neural Networks

  - 1st Model
    - Uses Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier
    - Compares the above two ML algorithms
      
  - 2nd Model
    - Using LSTM, one-hot representation
    - Sequential model with sigmoid activation function
    - Binary Cross entropy as loss function

  - Conclusion
    - Classification of Fake news into binary class labels was performed with an accuracy of over 90%.
    - Gained insights of how different models work on the same type of data to on my own intuitions and to draw some conclusions.
